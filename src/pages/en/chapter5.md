## Types of Code Samples


### Executable

Executable code samples are copy/paste, runnable. 

e.g. `npm init astro`


### Explanatory

Explanatory code samples are outputs / block of code that readers can learn from. 

e.g. a response object

## Code Sample Qualities

### Correct

Verify that the code sample works as intended, is complete, and is current and up-to-date (in the event of changes to the code).

### Contextual

When providing any code samples, explain prerequisites, limitations, context of the code.

When appropriate, include the file name/path, so it's obvious WHERE this code is/goes!

### Concise

Code samples should be *concise* but that doesn't necessarily mean short.

Only show the the features you are documenting in the current example. It's easier to read AND avoids the user copying more/irrelevant code if they want to use it. (If you're not demonstrating the styling of an element, strip out TailWind!)

### Accessible

Screenshots may be visually appealing, but require alt-text to be accessible to screen readers and do not allow the reader to copy for use in their own project! 

## Choosing Examples

Make sure your examples are
- Explained: provide the why, not the what, behind your sample
- Concise: minimal reproducible examples
- Clear: lean on existing style guide/conventions
- Extensible: make it clear when/how/where to amend to customize
- Trustworthy: be consistent and TEST YOUR EXAMPLES
