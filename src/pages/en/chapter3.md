## Tools

You probably spent a lot of time setting up your **coding** environment, to write *code*
- preferred IDE
- colour themes
- tools/extensions
- keybindings

YOU EXPERIMENTED UNTIL YOU FOUND YOUR COMFORT ZONE

Set yourself up similarly for writing docs! Choose your writing tools as carfully as you choose your dev tools!

Don't forget to consider:
- the format for your final content (eg if required output will Markdown, you need a Markdown editor)
- the shareability of drafts for feedback/review (if you will need to collaborate, you'll need to find a tool that works for all collaborators)

## Write for Skimming

There are two fundamental, paradoxical truths
1. Readers come to your docs looking for information.
2. Readers read very little of what you wrote.

Only when a reader has found what they are looking for do they sette in and read closely. Plan for this in your writing structure

### Title

- should summarize the GOAL for reading the doc (ie hint at *type* of documentation) and set appropriate EXPECTATIONS

    - "Tranlsating Dog Barks to Text" implies step-by-step
    - "Audio Encoding and Sampling Rates" implies a reference/tech specs
- consider what your reader needs to know and do to successfully complete the goal in the title 

### Headers
- headers are signposts, and guide the reader when skimming

### Call Outs
- e.g. warning, caution, note
- break the flow of text, so are useful for highlighting scenarios to avoid
- but, avoid "alert fatigue" (if everything is important, nothing is important)

## Getting Unstuck

- Remember, you can write out of sequence! Sometimes the "intro" will be the last thing you write.

    - Good introductions will describe a document's major themes, what readers will gain from reading it and why it matters. Sometimes you don't know all that until you're finished writing!

- Change your medium: switch to paper, a different app, voice transcription
