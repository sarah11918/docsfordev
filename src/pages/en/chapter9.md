Would love to measure something like &quot;How many pages/links did you have to click around on the site until you found what you wanted?&quot; but not sure I could even report that for myself on some sites given how much I get interested/distracted and click around! ðŸ˜‚ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DevEdBookClub?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DevEdBookClub</a></p>&mdash; Sarah Rainsberger (@sarah11918) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarah11918/status/1484350009931751433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Types of Document Purpose
"A document is good when it fulfills its purpose"

## Functional Quality

Quality of content. It provides the reader with the necessary and correct information

### Accessible

- uses language appropriate for a global audience where English familiarity is mostly expected, but proficiency may be low
- targets an appropriate reading level (10th grade is common standard)
- can be fully read by screen readers

### Purposeful

- clearly states upfront what this document should help the reader achieve
- does not stray from that purpose!

### Findable

- allows users to navigate easily and sensibly through the site
- considers BOTH site architecture, structure but also key/expected words
- Once readers make it to your site, do they make it to the right place??

> The real findability problem is how to get readers from the wrong place deep within your content to the right place deep within your content."
>
> Mark Baker, "Every Page is Page One"

### Accurate

- documents steps, processes, explanations are error-free

### Complete

- lists all prerequisite knowledge and steps
- documents ALL steps to complete a task
- defines or suggests the next steps the reader should take

## Structural Quality

Quality of language. It uses language that successfully communicates the necessary and correct information

- clear
- concise
- consistent

## Goals and Metrics

 Don't forget that you and your user have different sets of goals! Your reader's goals are smaller, and more specific.

| Org Goals | User Goals |
|-----:|:-----:|
|recruiting/onboarding new members | get started with an API |
|encourage existing members to adopt new features | authenticate with the API |
|retaining existing users | receive an alert when a task runs |
| addressing user needs/questions | fix a specific error message |

To evaluate the success of your documentation, align your business/organizational goals with reader goals through measurable success metrics.

| Reader Goal | Success Metric |
|-----:|:-----:|
| Learn the basics of the API to get started | Increased # of active users |


### Metrix Context

Does more page views mean more users? (YAY!) or simply more *frustrated* users? (BOO!)
