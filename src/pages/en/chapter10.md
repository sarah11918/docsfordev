But in particular, language like &quot;guard rails&quot; and &quot;escape hatches&quot; to describe navigational cues really captures being in, and being taken on &quot;a ride&quot; w docs <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DevEdBookClub?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DevEdBookClub</a></p>&mdash; Sarah Rainsberger (@sarah11918) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarah11918/status/1486892414518415361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Information Architecture

Not only helps users find what they need, but also gives you something you can maintain and scale.

How you organize your content conveys meaning and purpose to your readers!

### Landing Pages
Landing pages should route users to the right content with minimal reading required (Builds trust with the users by saving them time!)

- highlight the most relevant/important info
- create **guard rails** to guide users down the right path
- hide complexity that most users don't need right away
- let users choose their topic
- prepare users to find a particular resource

### Navigation

> Most users will arrive on a page that will simply get them close. Unfortunately, close isn't helpful if readers don't know how close they are or how to navigate FROM a page that's close TO the actual page they need.

1. Breadcrumbs
2. Side Navs
3. Labels and meta data
4. Prerequisite/next steps/additional info sections
5. Escape hatches: offer recommendations for alternative pages if reader discovers they are not on the right page

Navigation cues are crucial, but use them economically!
 - decision fatigue: too much is distracting and overwhelming
 - negative space (vs "fill everything"): helps feel oriented, organized


## Assessing Content

- a spreadsheet for each doc page
    - useful? up-to-date? in the right place?
    - actions: keep, remove, review for accuracy, merge split

- look for content gaps, features not documented
