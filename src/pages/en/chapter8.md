## Create user feedback channels

Possible feedback mechanisms include:

- directly through documentation (links to email, edit on GitHub) for page-level, granular feedback
- monitoring support issues and converting to doc issues when appropriate
- creating user surveys
- create a "user council" (group of current/potential users who agree to provide feedback)
- collect document "sentiment" e.g. "Was this helpful?" or "How do you feel about these docs?"

Note: User feedback will often be *contextual* and you can't ignore the state they were in when visiting the docs. If they came to the docs frustrated with a problem, you might be measuring their overall mood, not their reaction to the docs!

## Convert feedback to action

### Triage the feedback received

- Is the issue valid?
- Can the issue be fixed?
- Is the issue important? urgent? How much?

### Actionable Feedback

For feedback to be meaningful, it must be "actionable"

1. original (not a duplication of other feedback that might exist elsewhere in your feedback system)
2. reproducible (not unique to one user in one situation)
3. scoped (narrow enough scope to be fixable)

### Feedback followup

Feedback is a *conversation with your users*

Follow up to let them know feedback has been received, maybe when an issue has been resolved.

Thank the user for providing feedback!
