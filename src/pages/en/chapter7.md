## Where to publish

Documentation can exist in a variety of different locations: web site, blog post, GitHub gist, README.md, internal wiki. . . 

### Meet your users where they are.

| How do you want users to experience your content? | |
|----:|:----:|
|internal teams | private wiki?|
|external users | same repository as code on your website?|
|end users looking to install something | external software to avoid dependency loop? |

## How to publish

You should have a doc content release process, just like a software release process! (And take the same steps to avoid needing anyone on "pager duty")

### Plan for publishing
- timeline
- assigning responsibilities (e.g. final review)
- how to notify users? (announcement, email, social media)
- any additional tools needed?

## When to publish

Especially where changes are concerned, it make make the most sense to try to coordinate your doc publishing with your product release schedule
