## Types of Editing

There are different editing "passes" for different purposes.

### Technical Accuracy

- grammar, spelling
- consistency of terms
- content is accurate / steps are reproducible

### Completeness

- not the same as "telling people everything"
- it's just as easy to lose people with TOO MUCH info as it is with TOO LITTLE
- examples don't skip necessary steps

### Structure

- a consistent structure is predictable, and easy to follow
- check structure both within each document, as well as compare site-wide

### Clarity/Brevity

- don't overwhelm the reader with too much
- when editing, also consider bias and ableist language

## How to Receive Feedback

If others are editing your work, specify:
- HOW you'd like feedback (comments in a document, separate notes, PR)
- WHICH KIND of editing pass you'd like, to manage expectations (it's OK to say,"Right now, please just look for obvious grammar/proofreading errors" if you're not in a position to receive other feedback)

Start with the person who provided the MOST feedback (because it might pre-emptively address others' feedback)

Remember: evaluate each piece of feedback (don't just take at face value); not every bit of feedback is helpful, useful, actionable, nor needs to be addressed

**In the face of contradictory feedback, think of your user"**
